                <h2>DATA PROCESSING</h2>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0px;">Our processing of personal data will satisfy at least one of the
                    following processing conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consent. You have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes. You have
                        the
                        right to withdraw consent at any time but this will not affect the processing based on consent
                        before its withdrawal;</li>
                    <li>Necessary for the performance of a contract. The processing is necessary for the performance of
                        a
                        contract with you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract.
                        Where
                        this ground applies the provision of the information is a contractual requirement and if you
                        fail to
                        provide it we will be unable to provide the services that you have requested;</li>
                    <li>Legal obligation. The processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we
                        are subject;</li>
                    <li>Vital interests. The processing is necessary in order to protect your or another person’s vital
                        interests, e.g. in medical emergencies;</li>
                    <li>Public functions. The processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the
                        public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us;</li>
                    <li>Legitimate interests. The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
                        pursued by us or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by your interests
                        or
                        fundamental rights and freedoms which require the protection of personal data. Legitimate
                        interests
                        include the transfer of data for internal administrative purposes, market research activities,
                        direct marketing purposes, preventing fraud, ensuring network and information security, and
                        reporting criminal acts or threats to public security.</li>

                    Your rights as registered and your revocation of consent. The General Data Protection Regulation
                    guarantees you certain rights that you can assert over us. You have the right:</p>
                <ul style="padding-bottom: 0px;">
                    <li>To request confirmation from us as to whether personal data about you is being processed and, if
                        so, the specific circumstances of data processing (Article 15 GDPR: right of registration for
                        the
                        data subject);</li>
                    <li>To request that we immediately correct incorrect personal data about you In view of the purpose
                        of
                        the processing, you also have the right to request the completion of incomplete personal data,
                        including through a supplementary declaration (Article 16 GDPR: right of correction);</li>
                    <li>To request that we immediately delete personal data about you (Article 17 GDPR: the right of
                        deletion);</li>
                    <li>To request that we restrict processing (Article 18 GDPR: Right to restrict processing).</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="padding-top: 0px;">Finally, if you have given us your consent, you have the right to withdraw
                    your consent at any time.
                    In this case, all data processing performed by us up to the time you revoke your consent is still
                    legal. For this purpose, you can simply click on the link in each email and cancel the subscription
                    from the email service or send an email to support@wowcontents.com. Once you have revoked your
                    consent, we will no longer use the information you have provided for advertising purposes. We will
                    also not pass on your information to third parties for advertising purposes.
