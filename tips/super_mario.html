                <h3>The Basics</h3>
                <p>These basic gameplay tips for Super Mario Run aren't crazy hacks or cheats or anything, but they'll definitely get you off on the right foot. If you've already played a few rounds skip down for more advanced tips.
                </p>
                <h3>Micro-Jump
                </h3>
                <p>Mario will automatically vault over small obstacles and opponents that he runs into. This definitely comes in handy, because with a few minor exceptions, Mario is always running in this game.</p>
                <h3>Standard Jump
                </h3>
                <p>Lightly tapping on the screen will make Mario perform a simple jump. This is the main way to interact with the game, and it's what gives Mario Run its simple, addicting appeal.</p>
                <h3>Long Jump
                </h3>
                <p>Tapping and holding will give Mario an extra boost for a higher jump. When you let go of the screen, Mario starts to descend, so take a moment to get the timing of this maneuver down pat, because you'll be using it a lot.</p>
                <h3>360-Spin Jump
                </h3>
                <p>Spinning will give Mario a little more hang time to make his jumps even longer. To perform a spin jump, simply tap the screen again while Mario is already in midair.</p>
                <h3>Ninja Roll
                </h3>
                <p>A tap on the screen when Mario is about to fall off a ledge will make him do a barrel roll upon landing. Mario will also knock out any enemies nearby like a bowling pin while rolling.</p>
                <h3>Reverse Jump
                </h3>
                <p>Mario can jump backwards if you tap the screen as soon as Mario hits a wall. This trick is especially handy when falling into a pit, as it can save you from near-certain death.</p>
                <h3>Combo Jumps
                </h3>
                <p>Tap as soon as Mario vaults over a Goomba, and he will simultaneously crush his enemy and use it as a springboard to launch off of and gain some extra air.</p>
                <h3>Timing Is Key
                </h3>
                <p>Learn to time Mario's jumps carefully so that you can maximize his headbutting awesomeness. You can bash two blocks at once by hitting the seam in between the two, which can give Mario that extra advantage in collecting coins and other items.</p>
                <h3>Take Advantage of the Pause Blocks
                </h3>
                <p>For someone so pudgy, Mario's cardio is so good that your finger will sometimes struggle to keep up. To remedy this, always make sure to get on a pause block whenever they pop up. Don't worry, the timer will also pause as long as you're on the block, and it'll allow you to plan ahead and maximize Mario's run.</p>
                <h3>Use Directional Arrow Blocks to Unleash Havoc
                </h3>
                <p>Normally, arrow blocks help guide the way, pointing you towards hidden bonus coins. But occasionally, you'll come across some arrow blocks that are built into the ground. If you time your taps just right, you can use these as a springboard to shoot Mario off at double speed by jumping just as you step on the block.

                    Other times, you'll see arrow blocks pointing in the opposite direction from the way that Mario's travelling. When you hit these types of arrow blocks, you'll run backwards for a brief moment, which allows you jump on walls and pull off a few unique tricks.</p>
                <h3>Don't Rewind Too Far with the Bubble
                </h3>
                <p>There's a quirky advantage to getting KO'd in Mario Run. You can use the KO bubble to essentially rewind the level and give yourself another chance to grab whatever you may have missed the first time out. But the game clock keeps running while you're in the bubble, so be sure to keep track of the remaining time and balance it out with how far back in the level you want to go.</p>
                <h3>Take a Breather in Between Stages
                </h3>
                <p>Play Toad Rally and recharge your batteries. It's incredibly fun, and it also allows you to collect various colored Toads and unlock other rewards to help rebuild your little kingdom.</p>
                <h3>Minimize Your Risks
                </h3>
                <p>Remember, you want to collect Toads in Toad Rally, not lose them. You lose Toads whenever you lose the race, so pick your opponents wisely and don't make it too hard for yourself.</p>
                <h3>Collect Toads to Unlock Other Playable Characters
                </h3>
                <p>Collecting Toads to reside in your kingdom will also enable you to purchase houses for certain characters and subsequently unlock them. According to IGN, you need to collect the following colored Toads to unlock certain characters:
                </p>
                <p>Luigi: 150 green Toads and 150 purple Toads to purchase Luigi's house<br>
                    Yoshi: 30 red Toads and 30 yellow Toads to purchase Yoshi's house<br>
                    Toadette: 200 red Toads, 200 blue Toads, and 200 green Toads to purchase Toadette's house<br>
                    Princess Peach: Can be only unlocked by playing and beating every stage in the World Tour game mode, so finish the game if you want her on your team!</p>
                <h3>Redeem Toad and Unleash the Fungal Fury
                </h3>
                <p>Toad is by far the easiest character to unlock in Super Mario Run. Simply link your My Nintendo account in the game by going to your kingdom (the main screen) and tapping on the Nintendo icon in the upper-right corner. If you don't already have an account, you can sign in using Facebook and create a quick profile.</p>
                <p>After that, just tap on Toad and choose "Redeem." From there, go back to your kingdom, and tap on the gift box near the upper-right corner to finish unlocking Toad. Once you've unlocked Toad, you'll be able to play as the lovable mushroom-headed character (more on that later), who happens to be the fastest in the game.</p>
                <h3>Use the Characters You've Unlocked
                </h3>
                <p>After building their houses and unlocking new characters, go to your kingdom and tap "Menu," then "Notebook." From here, select "Characters," and then you can choose which character you'd like to play as.</p>
                <h3>Know Your Characters
                </h3>
                <p>Each playable character in Super Mario Run has a slightly different skill set, be it speed or jumping. Luigi can jump the highest of all the characters, Yoshi and Peach can stay mid-air longer (thanks to their ability to "float"), and Toad and Toadette are the fastest runners in the game. Knowing these attributes can help you clear certain levels that are more suited to each character.</p>
                <h3>Collect All the Challenge Coins
                </h3>
                <p>Replay value is part of the fun with Mario Run, as you can play each level over and over to your heart's content. Try replaying a level until you've collected all 5 special coinsâ€”this will reward you with Toad Rally Tickets. The stage will also level up and challenge you to collect a different set of special coins. The coin colors change from pink, to purple, and finally to black as the stages upgrade.</p>
                <h3>Check Your Kingdom for Bonus Games
                </h3>
                <p>Remember that mushroom house you built in your tutorial? That actually contains bonus games that refresh every 8 hours or so. Make sure to tap it every once in a while so that you can play bonus stages that'll earn you extra goodies.</p>
                <h3>Level Those Goombas Up
                </h3>
                <p>There's a meter showing how many enemies you've defeated at the end of each level. Once you max them out by stomping on as many enemies as possible, you level your enemies up and increase their worth. This, in turn, will earn you more coins each time you squash one of these types of enemies in Toad Rally.</p>
                <h3>Manage Power Consumption
                </h3>
                <p>You can conserve battery life while playing Super Mario Run by lowering the rendering and graphics settings in the game. Just tap the menu button, then head to "Settings," and choose "Options." From there, tap the rendering and graphics settings to switch them from high to low.</p>
