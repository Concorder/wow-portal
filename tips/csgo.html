                <h3>Find a team that fits you

                </h3>
                <p>Find a team you get along with. Sometimes in life we're all thrown into a situation where we have to work with people we aren't so fond of. Like at PC Gamer, for example. Bloody scoundrels, the lot of them. But there's no doubting that getting on with your team mates is going to make things a whole lot easier down the line. In fact, it might even be better to pick friendly souls with potential to improve than switching in the cream of the crop without knowing them well. "Playing with people you get along with will make you enjoy the game much more, and undoubtedly be more likely to stick together," says Elliot. "Changing your lineup every month won't do you much good, even if you're replacing a player with someone slightly better.</p>
                <h3>Practice in the right environment
                </h3>
                <p>Practice your tactics in the best environments If you're considering competitive Counter-Strike, the chances are you'll already spend a fair number of hours playing the game. But practicing in the right environments is key to your continual improvement. Deathmatch servers are a good place to start - "You respawn as soon as you die, so you're constantly shooting and it's a good way to improve your gunplay," Elliot explains - and clan war practice is pretty much essential. Use a chat program such as mIRC to search for practice games against other teams, and try out all the tactics you've been mulling over in your head. "I'd advise having ten minutes after each match you play to assess what you did wrong, what you did right, and how you could improve.

                    Forget the rest, play against the best It's always nice to win, so it might be tempting to select weaker opponents for practice matches. But this can be counter-productive. Unless you're playing at the highest level you're capable of, there's not a great deal of compulsion to improve - and certainly less you can take away from both victories and defeats.</p>
                <h3>Communication</h3>
                <p>Communication is key As with all team-based games, but perhaps even more so with Counter-Strike, it's important to be in good contact with your team mates throughout a match. A lack of communication can be the difference between a decisive victory and an embarrassing, crushing defeat, so talking to each other is tremendously important. But simply maintaining contact isn't enough: it's imperative to be efficient with your communications. "It's best to keep your calls about what's happening short and quick, and explain everything you know, such as how many enemies you see, if you see the bomb carrier, and what weapons they have," says Elliot. And be sure to get hold of a voice chat program such as Ventrilo or Mumble to utilise during practice: they allow you to speak to your team mates whether you're dead or alive, an advantage not afforded by Counter-Strike's in-game chat system.</p>
                <h3>Change tactics and positioning each round</h3>
                <p>Enemies get used to your position and know where to expect you in future rounds. Change your tactics and change your positioning. Even if you change your spot or exit point just a little bit, it can confuse your enemies.<br>

                    Selecting the right position gives you an advantage over the enemy. Use the structures on the map and reduce your opponent’s viewing angle to easily best your opposition.</p>
                <h3>Learn all points of the maps</h3>
                <p>Before you start playing on any map, it is necessary to thoroughly study it. Understanding the maps in CSGO distinguishes a professional player from a beginner. Professionals know where their enemy can appear and know how to move around in any situation. Knowing the maps will also boost your efficiency and speed while communicating with your teammates.</p>
                <h3>Grenades more dangerous than main weapon</h3>
                <p>According to statistics, beginners hardly throw grenades and mid-rank players throw a lot of grenades, but they often do so thoughtlessly. Professionals also use a lot of grenades, but they do it most effectively. Each grenade can do more good than any other firearm. The right smoke covering the right choke point or pass gives time to pick up on the enemy or to stop the fastest rush.</p>
