                <h3>The Essential Tomb of the Mask Tips and Tricks</h3>
                <p>Tomb of the Mask came out some time ago, but this mobile arcade game with a strong puzzle element continues to enthrall players all over the place. Because of that, the game is still exceedingly popular and many enjoy it regularly. Yet, the Tomb of the Mask also continues to be as challenging as it ever was. From creepy monkeys enemies to spike-covered walls, only the best of the best in this game can deal with it easily. Luckily for those who want to get better, there are some cool Tomb of the Mask tips and tricks that can enhance anyone’s results and success rate in the game.</p>
                <h3>Keeping on the Move
                </h3>
                <p>New players usually make the mistake when they start playing by either swiping too fast or too slow. In those cases, they end up being minced meat soon after that. The key is actually to combine both approaches. The players should move their mask fast when enemies approach, but then quickly slow down when they come near spiked walls, especially the blue ones. Here, a tactical approach should be used, followed once again by speeding up.</p>
                <h3>Getting More Coins and Spending them Wisely
                </h3>
                <p>No one can advance in this game (like in almost any other) if they do not have access to in-game currency. In Tomb of the Mask, this currency is the coins that the players pick up. This is why Coin Addict is the key for getting more coins, especially when it is combined with the Magnet power-up. Once activated, the Coin Addict is able to turn the dots around the player into coins. Picking them up means generating more funds while playing and this is essential for advancement in the game. Also, the players should avoid spending coins on reviving their character or playing the Wheel of Fortune. This is nothing but a waste of money. Instead, they should be used for new masks and power-ups.</p>
                <h3>Forgetting to use the Shield
                </h3>
                <p>After Maze 3, the players gain access to a shield power-up. It is activated with a double tap and from that point on, it will be really useful, even though it lasts only for a few short seconds. The shield is also nullified when the players hit an obstacle. In all of the swiping, players regularly forget they can employ the shield to ward off danger, at least for a short while - often, this will be all they need.</p>
                <h3>New Masks are Essential
                </h3>
                <p>Like it was already stated, the masks are the best way to spend coins and here is where the players can actually get an edge. As the players reach new levels, additional masks will appear, all of them having their own advantages and perks. The purchased masks become a part of the player’s collection, so anyone can be used at any time. In this sense, Tomb of the Mask is similar to games like Hotline Miami - in both games, different masks provide different benefits. It is up to the player to figure out which one works best for a particular maze they are facing.</p>
