            <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>World of Warcraft: Classic released worldwide on August 27th. World of Warcraft Classic is a faithful recreation of the original WoW experience, as it was all the way back in 2006. Everything from Vanilla WoW, including combat mechanics, talent trees, character models, dungeons and zone layouts, has been thoroughly restored to recreate a truly authentic experience, allowing veteran players to revive their adventures in the older version of Azeroth, as well as granting newer players a true taste of the game as it was in its infant years.</p>
            <h3>Installing Classic WoW</h3>
                <p>All players with an active World of Warcraft subscription can install and play Classic WoW at no additional cost! You will install Classic WoW via your Battle.net Client.

                    Open your Battle.net desktop client and select World of Warcraft in the left-side menu.

                    On the version dropdown menu, select World of Warcraft Classic. If you have more than one World of Warcraft account, you will see a second dropdown showing all accounts linked to your Battle.net. Select the account you wish to play Classic WoW with. Remember that you must have an active World of Warcraft subscription to play Classic WoW.

                    Click the Install button. After selecting an installation folder, your Classic WoW client will start downloading, and the Battle.net Client will show you once the game is available to play. Once Classic WoW is fully downloaded and installed, simply press Play and prepare for your new adventure in Azeroth!</p>
            <h3>Selecting a Realm
            </h3>
                <p>Once you enter Classic WoW, you will need to select a realm to play on, from a pool of distinct realm names and types. If you're playing with friends, make sure you pick the same realm as your friends.<br>

                    Normal: The best realm type for new players, this type is best for players who do not wish to engage in open-world PvP.<br>

                    PvP (Player vs. Player): This realm type allows for open-world PvP to happen at any moment in all areas, except areas that are considered safe (such as the starting zones, the first areas where players begin their adventure).<br>

                    RP (Role-Play): These realms are ideal for players who wish to take part in role-playing their character with others!<br>

                    RPPvP (Role-Play, Player vs. Player): These realms follow the same ruleset as the RP realms, but with the added rules of PvP servers.</p>
                <h3>Creating a new Character</h3>
                <p>After you've selected your desired realm, you'll be brought to the Character Selection screen, where you will be able to create a new character to begin your journey with. You're able to choose your faction, class and race, as well as customize many options in your character and give them their very own name.

                    There are four Alliance races and four Horde races you can choose from:
                    Druids, Hunters, Mages, Paladins, Priests, Rogues, Shaman, Warlock, Warriors.

                    Create your character very carefully to make sure you like its appearance, as you will not be able to change it after your character is created! You can use Wowhead's Classic Dressing Room to get started with customizing your character.

                    After your character is fully created, it is time to log in! You will log in your race's starting zone. Each race begins in a specific region in Azeroth, and some locations are even shared among certain races.</p>
                <h3>Starting your First Quest
                </h3>
                <p>As you first log into your character, one of the first things you will notice is a NPC with a golden exclamation mark above his head not far from your location. This NPC will give you your first quest. Go to the NPC and talk to him by clicking on him with your right mouse button and you will have your very first mission!

                    As you complete quests and gain levels, new quests will open. Maintain a sharp eye around your surroundings for those gold exclamation marks for new quests! In case you encounter a silver exclamation point on top of a NPC's head, this means the NPC has a quest for you, but you need to level up more to be able to start this quest.</p>
                <h3>Classic WoW Phases System</h3>
                <p>To truly recreate the authentic Vanilla experience, not all Classic content will be released right away - Content will be staggered in different patches called phases. It is currently predicted that Blizzard will be releasing patches every few months. Classic release will start in Phase 1 with very basic systems such as no honor system and only the first two raids in WoW.
