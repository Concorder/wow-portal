            <h3>intro</h3>
                <p>EA Game and Respawn Entertainment decided to take on the battle royale genre and Apex Legend is the huge result that is quickly becoming a big crowd favorite. However, it is still a substantially different game than what the audience came to expect from these titles. This is the reason why both novice players and veterans of other shooter games might be surprised to find out that this title works using its own rules. To help in that crucial process of adjustment and accommodation, here is a list of most important tips and tricks that everyone can use.</p>
            <h3>Weapon Attachment Management
            </h3>
                <p>When a new weapon is picked up by the player, the UI will present which attachments from your current gun can be transferred. This speeds up the process of attachment management and allows the players to quickly mix and match whatever they like, instead of having the extra step of returning the particular item back to the inventory. The process definitely streamlines the shooter game experience and removes the simulation element - because of this, new players would be advised to use the feature and switch their add-ons as fast as possible.</p>
                <h3>Using the Absence of Fall Damage
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Many battle royale games ended prematurely when a player made a step in the wrong direction and found themselves falling to their death. Apex Legends does not include that element and players are free of damage coming from any kind of a fall. This means that even the highest locations can be traversed by simply jumping down. The same goes for using weapons during a fall - with some good aiming and a bit of luck, players will be able to take down opponents just as they are coming in for a landing.</p>
                <h3>Pursuing Legendary Loot
                </h3>
                <p>In the game, the rarer the weapon or some other item, the more useful it is in the field of battle. Visually, the rareness factor is showcased by color, starting with white, then blue and purple and finally orange that represents legendary loot. This might seem obvious, but higher tiers of weapons and gear are always a better choice than the lower ones, regardless of their attachment. New players should constantly be on the lookout for new equipment and higher tiers, no matter how well they might think they’re doing in the present moment.</p>
                <h3>Using Revival Machines
                </h3>
                <p>In Apex Legends, there are two types of revival for the player’s teammates. The first one includes helping the team members who are simply down. This is done much in the same manner as any other battle royale game. But, the revival machine includes the ability of a team to revive a long-dead comrade using nothing more than the banner they leave after their death. Once they use this banner in one of the revival machines that are scattered through the map, their comrade will come back. The only drawback is that once a machine is used, it cannot be employed in the same manner again.

                    With these simple tips and tricks unique to the Apex Legends game, anyone will be able to play drastically better in their upcoming matches.</p>
                <h3>Where to get them and how to use them</h3>
                <p>Apex Legends is Respawn’s new battle royale game that is currently blowing up in the gaming community. Like many of the best battle royale titles, it is able to appeal both to FPS fans and those who played the royale modes in different games. Yet, as a free-to-play game, Apex Legends still has that element of in-game currency that no player can afford to completely ignore. In fact, those who do want to play the game for a prolonged period and do well at it will have to get a good grip of the game’s monetization and ways it can be used to the player’s advantage. This is not an easy task, but with the proper information, it can be done using the in-game coins. Here is an overview of Apex Legends coins and the ways any player can both gather them up and then use them for the highest possible efficiency.</p>
                <h3>Apex Coins Explained
                </h3>
                <p>Apex Legends Coins, also known as Yellow coins or Apex Coins (not to be confused with the unrelated ApexCoin cryptocurrency) are the premium currency in this title. This means that they are the highest tier of any in-game valuable and that they can be purchased using real-life money. In the game, they are used to buy featured characters, new skins, and packs that include a bundle of random cosmetic items. As of early February 2019, featured skins in the game’s store cost shy than 2000 Apex Coins, while exclusive ones go between 6000 and 10,000 coins. Individual cosmetic packs cost 100 coins while 700 coins will unlock additional Legends who are Mirage and Caustic.</p>
                <h3>How to Get Apex Coins
                </h3>
                <p>As a premium currency, Apex coins are the most valuable commodity in the game. This means that they can be purchased only by using real-world money. A player can do this by going to the in-game Store and buying the coins. The smallest deal right now is the offer of getting 1000 coins for $9.99. From there, the deals get better as the prices increase, primarily because the developers produce a bonus on the number of coins a person buys. Here is how the prices are currently set for above previously mentioned $9.99:
                </p>
                <p>2000 coins and a 150 bonus – $19.99<br>
                    4000 coins and a 350 bonus – $39.99<br>
                    6000 coins and a 700 bonus – $59.99<br>
                    10000 coins and a 1500 bonus – $99.99<br>
                </p>
                <p>Clearly, the higher the price the better the deal.</p>
                <h3>Spending Wisely
                </h3>
                <p>With these prices, it should go without saying that anyone willing to spend real money in the game should proceed carefully. Before rushing in, a player should decide what they really want and what can't wait for a week or two. Right now, it is not hard to imagine a player spending waste amounts of cash on these things, being that Apex Legends is a really fun and dynamic game.</p>
