                <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>The FIFA franchise series, as one of the heavyweights of the sports gaming world, is clearly a title many people anxiously await every year. Now, FIFA19 is here and the game is proving to be as popular as many of its best-selling sequels so far. Yet, with the overall improvements on all fronts, the game also comes with a new level of challenge that all have to master if they want to showcase their best possible game. To do that, players need to have in-depth knowledge about the game and all of its key new features. Some of these will be minute, while others are huge and prominent in literally every match - however, all of these are essential for having an ability to play a great game. Here are the most important tips and tricks for all FIFA19 players.</p>
                <h3>Using The Driven Shot</h3>
                <p>A rounded player has to go for the powerful driven shot. In this version, it is used by going for L1, R1 and Shoot combo. At close range, the players should charge it up to the very end to get a guaranteed goal. The driven shot is also super-useful in one-on-one setups, while it can also provide great results in volleys if they are timed right.</p>
                <h3>Keeping The Speed In Check
                </h3>
                <p>Bad players of FIFA always use the sprint button. This is a general problem for most players of the FIFA series, but in this edition, anyone looking to play well must tackle this. Because of this, a great tip is to go for a sprint only when on a counter-attack and fast goal approaches. Otherwise, players will only regularly lose the ball or fail to receive a pass because of being in sprint mode.</p>
                <h3>Going for Timed Finishing</h3>
                <p>The Timed Finish feature is new in this edition of the game and it has three separate levels indicating the chances for a successful goal. These indicators change the color of the selected player in the moment of shot release. While Timed Fishing will not make a big difference in the box, any shot from a greater distance should use it, being that the feature will provide both more power and accuracy to the attempt.</p>
                <h3>Relying on the Ground Cross
                </h3>
                <p>This feature is not that important when playing against an AI, but it is crucial for any human opponent. Basically, it is a dribble bluff move that is activated with a double press of the cross. Usually, the other player will not be expecting a ground cross and pulling one off successfully is a great way to thin-out the defensive line and build up a goal chance.

                    Using just one of these tips will enhance the game of any FIFA19 players, but employing all of them is a sure way towards becoming an amazing FIFA game player.</p>
                <h3>Boxing The Attackers
                </h3>
                <p>FIFA19 comes with a very simple yet very effective command that is accomplished by pressing Up twice during an attack on the D-pad. When a player does this, the rest of the attackers in the squad will rush into the box, ready for a pass. This makes the chance of a successful shot inside of the goal a lot more likely, as well as exploiting a mistake by the defense.</p>
                <h3>Switching Players with the Right Stick
                </h3>
                <p>Usually, in FIFA19, players go for either LB or L1 to change and switch their players. However, there is also the possibility of using the right stick. The reason for this is to provide a more diverse player selection. L1 switches the players who are nearest to the ball. Of course, this is excellent for short-distance passes, but for anything longer, more players should be considered. This is where the right stick comes in.</p>
                <h3>Never Missing Out On A Will-Executor Corner Or Free Kick
                </h3>
                <p>In some version of the FIFA series, players ignored the free and corner kicks as having little value - in fact, many perceived them as completely out of their control. FIFA19 is nothing like that. Instead, both of these stoppage kicks can offer the potential for an easy goal for those who know what they are doing. This demands practice, but the main idea is to position two players with a chance of scoring and then chose one that seems to be better off in the last second before release. Then, using L2 or LT for a gentle first touch, the player should immediately go for the goal, no matter where they are in the box.</p>
                <h3>Using Tactics
                </h3>
                <p>FIFA19 provides a huge range of tactical solutions for the matches, so going for the Dynamic Tactic menu should be a regular part of any well-rounded player. The same goes for the Quick Tactics option which allows for changes during the match itself. Both should be used whenever possible in or before a hard match.</p>
