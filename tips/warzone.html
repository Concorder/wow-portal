                <h3>Warzone modes: Battle Royale & Plunder
                </h3>
                <p>Warzone includes two separate PvP multiplayer modes: Battle Royale, and Plunder. Both modes are available to select from the main Warzone menu.

                    Taking place on the colossal map Verdansk, you must drop down alone or as a team, gear up, avoid the encroaching circular border, and fight to be the last one standing out of up to 150 players.

                    Plunder is a slightly less tense game mode, where the aim is to accrue as much Cash as possible before time runs out. You can earn Cash by looting the map, completing contracts, and killing other players. If you die you respawn within a few seconds, but you lose all your Cash.</p>
            <h3>Vehicles in Warzone</h3>
                <p>
                    There are five types of vehicle available in Warzone, and you can find many of each type scattered across the map every match. Here’s how Infinity Ward describe each one:<br>

                    ATV - two-seater, provides minimal protection, good at off-roading, fast.<br>

                    Tactical Rover - four seater, provides minimal protection, solidly fast, solid at off-roading.<br>

                    SUV - four seater, provides good protection, medium speed, not ideal for off-roading.<br>

                    Cargo Truck - holds the squad plus equipment, excellent protection, not for off-roading, slowest.<br>

                    Helicopter - four seater, decent coverage, flies.
                </p>
                <h3>Cash & Contracts</h3>
                <p>Cash is the currency of the Warzone game modes. In Plunder, the aim is to earn the most Cash, but it’s also an extremely important resource in the Battle Royale mode.

                    There are several ways to earn Cash. You can find Cash strewn about the world as loot; you can kill other players to earn Cash rewards; and you can pick up and complete Contracts.

                    There are multiple different types of Contracts which can be activated by picking up the Contract dossier as a loot drop. Your squad can only activate one Contract at a time.

                    Some contracts may include finding and opening supply boxes, or killing specific targets, or securing a specific location, just to name a few. As well as earning you Cash, completing Contracts may earn your team unique abilities such as seeing the next circle location before it starts to close.</p>

                <h3>Heal between fights</h3>
                <p>Cash is so important in Warzone Battle Royale because of Buy Stations. There are many Buy Stations scattered across the map (which you can see on the map overlay), and they all offer you powerful upgrades and rewards in exchange for Cash.

                    Examples of what you can buy at Buy Stations include Field Upgrades such as UAV drones, equipment such as Armor Plates and Gas Masks; and even lethal Killstreak rewards such as airstrikes.

                    But most importantly, with enough Cash you can use a Buy Station to deploy a Loadout Drop. This will drop a crate at your location which will allow you to pick a preset loadout of weapons, perks, and equipment - the ultimate reward.</p>

                <h3>Survival is important (don’t give up)
                </h3>
                <p>As obvious of a tip this may seem, Warzone takes a slightly different approach to the loop of running, gunning, and quitting to join another game after getting gunned down. Between the Gulag system and the ample Buy stations scattered around the map, there are lots of chances for your squad to get back to fighting strength, and possibly make a tremendous comeback. While other squad-focused battle royale games inspire feelings of dread and aimlessness after your teammates have been wiped, you still have a decent shot at reviving them if you have the cash and can manage to evade danger--provided they haven't quit the game.

                    Compared to other BR games, it's pretty easy to get teammates back in Warzone--but you can't do that if you're dead. So stay focused and calm, even when the odds are against you.</p>

                <h3>Don’t forget to mount your weapon!
                </h3>
                <p>Warzone's tutorial does a good job of teaching you the absolute basics, including one aspect you'll be familiar with if you've played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: the ability to mount your weapon. This involves using an object nearby to steady your weapon, reducing the amount of recoil you have to compensate for when firing your gun. Understandably, this can be easy to forget in the middle of combat. While there are certainly times that it's better to maintain your mobility, the ability to fire accurately can mean the difference between life and death in certain engagements. Try to make use of this early and often as you begin playing Warzone so that you can build muscle memory rather than allowing this ability to become an afterthought.</p>
