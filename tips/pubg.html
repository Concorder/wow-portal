                <h3>Weapons</h3>
                <p>PUBG features a large range of realistic weapons to help you battle it out with other players. These range from melee weapons like machetes all the way up to fully automatic machine guns. In the early part of a match, being the first person in your immediate area to get your hands on a pistol can be the difference between life or death.</p>
                <h3>Assault Rifle or Uzi</h3>
                <p>The weapons in PUBG offer a versatile range of options depending on your setting. Within buildings when engaging in combat, one of the many shotguns available or a submachine gun such as an Uzi are often your best choice. While outdoors, it's much preferred to have an assault rifle or sniper rifle featuring a powerful scope that allows you to deal with other players from a distance.</p>
                <h3>Rate of Fire</h3>
                <p>With multiple different types of guns in each weapon class, it's not really worth explaining the intricacies of each individual weapon. Once you hop into PUBG and play a few rounds, you will quickly get an idea for the rate of fire of each weapon, and which guns you prefer.</p>
                <h3>Scopes</h3>
                <p>The best guns in PUBG aren't much good beyond a distance of 200 metres unless you are seriously good at aiming using the build-in iron sights. A few weapons like the VSS rifle and the crossbow come with build-in scopes, but most other guns in PUBG require you to find a separate scope and attach it to the weapon.</p>
                <h3>Red Dot</h3>
                <p>Red dot and holographic sights will improve your aim by providing slight magnification and giving you the ability to temporarily hold your breath to steady your shot. From there, scopes increase in magnification from 2x, 4x, 8x, and 15x. For most players, a 4x scope provides a happy medium between range and visibility. Scopes such as the 8x are great for dealing with enemies from a long distance, but aren't much use later in PUBG when most combat occurs within close quarters.</p>
                <h3>Attachments</h3>
                <p>A wide range of weapon attachments can be found around the map that improve your gun in one way or another. Flash hiders and suppressors help to conceal your location from enemies, while angled and vertical foregrips provide increased stability and reduce the recoil of your weapon. Magazines can include the features "extended" (increased ammo capacity), "quickdraw" (reload your weapon faster), or both. Other attachments such as bullet loops or cheek pads are specialised to a certain type of weapon, and it may take a while to figure out what types of attachments are compatible with which guns.

                    There are a handful of throwable items in Playerunknown's Battlegrounds that can get you out of sticky situations. A frag grenade is great to lob toward a hiding player to either flush them out of their position or kill them without exposing yourself to gunfire. Smoke grenades can help hide your movement, allowing you to get between buildings without taking fire. Molotov cocktails will set players and vehicles ablaze, while stun grenades emit a blinding white light that temporarily obscures the vision of any players who look at them when they explode.</p>
                <h3>Armour</h3>
                <p>The armour in PUBG comes in two forms: helmets and bulletproof vests. Each of these items comes in three levels of quality. Level one armour is the lowest quality, while level three armour is the highest.</p>
