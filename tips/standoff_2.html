                <h3>Preparing to play Standoff 2</h3>
                <p>
                    While playing campaign mode may not require much thought, playing Standoff 2 (or any game for that matter) in a competitive mode will require some optimization for best experience.

                    Optimization measures becomes more important especially on older phones or devices. The reality is, playing any kind of FPS or MOBA games at an optimal level greatly depends on the frame rate output of the device. Frame rate is measured in frames per second.

                    One strategy to improving gaming performance on older devices is to power cycle the device before launching the game. It is also a good idea to close any unnecessary programs running in the background, such as Bluetooth connections, WIFI, and other programs.

                    The controls and gameplay mechanic for Standoff 2 is almost identical to other FPS games like Call of Duty, Modern Strike Online etc. There are some minor differences that may trip you up, crouching being one of those instances. You must press the crouching button once to crouch and once more to get in the normal walking position.

                    Perhaps one of the best features of the game is the ability to customize the controls and in-game settings to your liking.</p>

                    <p>The best settings for one player may not be so great for another. However, the following seem to be the optimal settings:<br>

                    1. Game detail setting: Depending on your device, you will need to tweak the detail settings to achieve a balance of good visuals and good performance with high frame rates.<br>
                    Turn off switch weapons on pickup: It can be a nuisance at times switching back to a prior weapon after picking up a new weapon. Turning off this option allows you to add items to inventory and equipping them as need. Switch weapon on pick up may be useful for new players testing out different weapons. But for an advance player, its may only be a stumbling block.<br>
                    2. Button sensitivity: Button sensitivity will depend on your personal preference. However, higher sensitivity is usually better for the most part. After finding a good setting, try to stick to it.<br>
                    3. Turn off acceleration: It is recommended that you disable (set to 0) acceleration for best results, at least at first. The acceleration setting in Standoff 2 controls the sensitivity for the camera or player swivel movements. Most players turn this off or set it very low and compensate for this by tracking their forward and back movements.<br>
                    4. Crosshair customization settings: The crosshair can also be set based on your own liking. The crosshair setting that works best are, point size 0, line thickness between 5.0 and 10.0, line length between 20 and 25, line distance between 2.0 and 3.0.<br>
                    5. Another good tip is to disable any unnecessary options in the game. Taking these steps will help to eliminate any potential latency or lag.   </p>


                <h3>The best weapons</h3>
                <p>The ideal weapon will vary base a player preference, skill level and game mode.  Based on damage and fire rate, the AKR is the best weapon. These are the best weapons in order of best to worst based on these numbers:
                <br></p><p>

                   1. AKR<br>
                    2. M4<br>
                    3. M16<br>
                    4. AKR12<br>
            </p>
                <h3>Understanding the maps
                </h3>
                <p>The player most familiar with his surrounding will dominate. The important thing is not to so much react to an opponent, but instead to expect and anticipate their positions.
                    To do that you will need to get good at mapping the radar display on the top left with the actual environment.
                    Its important to know where enemies can and can’t emerge from. Learn what positions they can flank from. With this knowledge, as you move through map, you will be one step ahead of the opponent.</p>
                <h3>Game modes
                </h3>
                <p>There are several game modes to choose from in Standoff 2. However, we will only cover the two most popular.
                    Team death match is the standard 10-minute rounds where teams of five player go head to head. The team with the most kills after 10 minutes wins the match.
                    Team death match is the best game mode to gain experience points and improve overall skills.
                    In diffused game mode, one team is the counter terrorist and the other team are the terrorist. The counter terrorist team must prevent the terrorist team from planting and setting off the bomb. Meanwhile, the terrorist team must plant the bomb and guard it so the other team does not deactivate it. Defused is perhaps the most entertaining game mode in Standoff 2.</p>
                <h3>Mastering reaction times
                </h3>
                <p>Improving reactions times along with the other tactics in this guide is enough to take your game from beginner to pro. The first tip to improving your reaction time is to always keep the crosshair at head height.
                    It is also a good point to get to know the weapon you are using. Get to know its range and recoil patterns. By using burst fire, you can improve spread control.
                    Also get to know your opponents. What path they take? Are they in groups? How fast are they rushing or not rushing? Try to pick up on patterns in their actions. By doing that, you can pick up a lot of information on your opponent and be ten steps ahead of them.
                    Rather than holding a controller, you would be holding a phone. The claw form is basically the equivalent to keeping the fingers on the home keys of a keyboard.
                    It may look awkward and complicated at first, but it doesn’t take long to get accustom to. You can tweak your button placements until you find a good grip for your liking.</p>
