                <h3>Beginners Guide
                </h3>
                <p>Since Google Maps were opened to developers of apps and play-offs, there has been a massive invention of AR play-offs by some big IPs. One of them is Jurassic Earth: Live. Canada, Montreal, and Universal city in partnership with Ludia, a big mobile-play-off developer, are set to launch it this year. It will be the first time that mobile play-offs introduce the Mesozoic Earth behemoths thrill to life.
                    <br>
                    The behemoths will be able to walk and interact freely together with fans through augmented reality and location-based technology. Below is a guide on how to play it. Mesozoic Earth Live will be the third mobile play-off to partner with Ludia and Universal for the sensational Mesozoic Earth movie series.
                    <br>
                    It is set to be launched earthwide on Google Play and the App Store just before the arrival of Mesozoic Earth: Fallen Kingdom, which is set to premiere in theatres all over Canada and the United States on 22nd June 2018.
                    <br>
                    This is a video game company based in Montreal that develops and sells multiple platform digital play-offs.
                    <br>
                    Their innovative and top-class product portfolio has some of the most popularly branded properties like Teenage Mutant Turtles, Mesozoic Earth and Family Feud, among others. Ludia is a part of the FremantleMedia family. This is a leading producer of content.</p>
            <h3>How the Jurassic World Alive Works</h3>
            <p>Imagine living among behemoths that walk freely at the park, which is just a distance away from your house.

                This is the setting that the Mesozoic Earth: Live brings to your earth. It then challenges you to collect as much dinosaur DNA as you can. hese majestic prehistoric creatures have come back to take over the earth. This is after they ran away from Mesozoic Earth on the Isla Nubla Island and are now walking freely in the neighbourhoods and cities. As a member of the new Dinosaur Protection Group (DPG), you are given the mission of saving these creatures from their second extinction.

                You are then supposed to explore your neighbourhoods and towns, looking for your favourite dinos. These include new breeds that are more terrifying and inspiring than ever. You are supposed to activate AR in order to interact with these big creatures in a real earth. This is a thrilling experience for any player. In Mesozoic World Live, a player can collect different behemoths as he explores their habitats and towns across the globe.

                There are many exclusive dinos and free-in play-off incubators that are lying behind each corner, waiting for the player to discover them. Also, there are many mind-boggling creatures that have been featured in the Mesozoic Earth: Fallen Kingdom. What the Mesozoic Earth Live is trying to do is immerse players fully into a planet infested with live dinosaurs. It is going to do this in a way that no man has ever imagined.

                The players will get an opportunity to go on an exploration expedition and connect with other like-minded players. They will then build and get to interact with these strong ancient species that they have only heard about or seen in films.

                To make the Mesozoic Earth Live look realistic, the developers have used the most recent augmented reality (AR) technology. This will allow these players to pose and capture videos and photos with all the dinosaurs they have managed to collect during their gameplay.

                To locate the creatures, players will have to use maps and deploy an in-activity drone that is meant for collecting DNA samples. The player then gets the ability to go up one level and create other behemoths that are genetically modified in the lab. They can also do real-time multiple players arena battle competitions where they will win rewards.

                Mesozoic Earth fans have always had a dream of interacting with these fierce and majestic creatures in their real lives.

                With the advanced augmented reality and location technology that is available today, players can finally make their dream come true.</p>
