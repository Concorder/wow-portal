                <h3>Career Mode Bargain Players and Best Buys
                </h3>
                <p>The career mode has a huge number of players from different teams, and figuring out which ones to buy to get the most out of your money can be tricky.

                    In this section of the guide, we will look at some of the best players to pick up - ones that are affordable but have a lot of potential to grow to become great first team players.</p>
                <h3>Career Mode Bargain Players and Best Buys</h3>
                <p>The top picks are:<br>
                    Elias Abouchabaka, RB Leipzig (CAM)<br>
                    Marcus Edwards, Totenham Hotspur (RM)<br>
                    Fiete Arp, Hamburger SV (ST)<br>
                    Christian Fruchtl, Bayern Munchen (GK)<br>
                    Alessandor Bastoni, Atlanta (CB)<br>
                    Rodney Konglo, Doncaster Rovers (CDM)<br>
                    Mamadou Doucoure, Borussia M'gladback (CB)<br>
                    Nedim Bajrami, Grasshopper Club Zurch (CM)<br>
                    Toshiki Onozawa, Cerezo Osaka, (LM)</p>
                <h3>Career Mode Bargain Players and Best Buys</h3>
                <p>These are all players that start with low OVR but that have high Growth potential. It can be tempting to pick up a whole load of players that have 90 ratings - but you don't actually need them to do well in the career.

                    If you buy a 17 or 18 year old that has good potential, you can pick them up cheaply, and grow them over a period of several years.</p>
                <h3>Career Mode Bargain Players and Best Buys</h3>
                <p>Try to get the players with the best potential, and aim to retain them. Remember that sometimes a player won't be interested in changing teams - players that have just signed to a new club tend to want to stay there.<br>

                    If you can't get a player that you have your eye on, look for others that have high potential and that are available for transfer.<br>

                    Remember that players grow through experience. If you're keeping a kid on the bench then they won't reach their full potential.<br>

                    So, spend a little on some great players when the chance arises, but invest in those hidden gems and develop them too.</p>
                <h3>Best Ultimate Team FUT 18 and Career Players by Ratings</h3>
                <p>You may be able to build a good team just by looking at names and match performance, but player ratings are ideal for people who want to min-max. Knowing what the ratings mean, and knowing what is worth spending money on, will give you the best chance of success in the game, whether you're trying to win in Ultimate Team or Career mode.</p>
                <h3>Here's a quick look at the top 10 players by Overall Rating (OVR):
                </h3>
                <p>Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid) - OVR 94<br>
                    Lionel Messi (Barcelona) - OVR 93<br>
                    Neymar da Silva Santos Jr. (PSG) - OVR 92<br>
                    Luis Suarez (Barcelona) - OVR 92<br>
                    Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munchen) - OVR 92<br>
                    Robert Lewandowski (Bayern Munchen) - OVR 91<br>
                    Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid) - OVR 90<br>
                    Eden Hazard (Chelsea) - OVR 90<br>
                    Toni Kroos (Real Madrid) - OVR 90<br>
                    Gonzalo Higuain (Juventus) - OVR 90</p>
                <p>If you were to try to buy just the players with overall ratings of 90 or higher, then your team would run out of money quite quickly. You can mix and match the players with high overall ratings with others that are younger but that have a lot of potential. This may mean accepting a few losses early on to develop some newer players, but over a period of years those young stars will develop high OVRs themselves.</p>
                <p>Take a look at the skill move ratings of the players before you buy them. Remember that to do skill moves with players, they need to have a star rating that is either equal to or higher than the move you are trying to do. If you want to be able to show off with those moves in a game, then you will need some five star rated players on your main 11.</p>
