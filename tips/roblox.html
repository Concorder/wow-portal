                <h3>Personalisation of your avatar</h3>
                <p>This can begin by changing the colour of your character. Once you have selected your avatar, you need to click on the character option. You can then select small portions of a simple picture of the robloxian displayed at the bottom of your screen. A wide range of colours is available for you to choose from. As you make progress, you will earn coins. You can use these to purchase different items including clothes. You'll soon notice that most of the other players are fully and fashionably dressed. You don't have to be the odd one out. The wardrobe, where all the clothes you bought had been kept, can be accessed from the character page. Dress up your character and get back to gaming.</p>
                <h3>Take advantage of fall down stairs
                </h3>
                <p>Given that this is a creative platform, you get to be in charge of how you'll want the characters to look like. The ninja mask and roll head can be used to make hair and make your custom character attractive.

                    Here, you get an opportunity to earn a lot of points. Points are awarded in good measure if you can get body parts to come in contact and teleport. The amounts of points you earn here is directly proportional to the frequency with which you can get this done. Every time you approach stairs, be careful to reset. You will earn more than you can imagine if you get this right.</p>
                <h3>Earn robux</h3>
                <p>Robux, the main currency, is used for numerous transactions. One of the targets you should have is to increase your revenue. Be a part of the builders club to make this a reality. You will receive a daily stipend as a member while being allowed to sell clothes and share some of the proceeds.

                    You could also sell passes to earn revenue. For non members the profits will be less. An affiliate program that gives gamers an opportunity to earn more coins is also available. Exploit all these options and get rich.</p>
                <h3>Trade currency</h3>
                <p>You can always exchange the coins that you accumulate along the way. The trade currency option allows you get tix or robux depending on what you would like to have. All you need to do is to key in what you want.</p>
