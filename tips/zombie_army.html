                <h3>Use Upgrade Kits
                </h3>
                <p>Upgrade kits are integral to progressing through the game. Players will find kits in each chapter and can use them to improve both weapons and armor. The thing to keep in mind is that these can't be used as soon as they are found, but players must wait until they stumble upon a workbench. Quests will continue to increase in difficulty, so it is a good idea to use these kits as soon as players can.</p>
                <h3>Pick The Right Upgrades
                </h3>
                <p>Just because the player has the ability to upgrade, doesn't mean that they should just upgrade their weapons randomly. There are specific kinds of upgrades that players should try to prioritize first. Any upgrades that add element damage to weapons are the first that players should strive for. This will give weapons the ability to cause more damage, and will also allow damage to spread out to other zombies as well. These upgrades will provide the advantage that players need.</p>
                <h3>Grenades And Stomping Are A Godsend
                </h3>
                <p>It is incredibly important to learn to use grenades and the stomping mechanic to take care of zombies. Grenades are perfect for clearing out large groups of enemies and can really come in a pinch in overwhelming situations. Players should try their best to use grenades whenever they see an opportunity, but shouldn't overuse. Stomping is a new game mechanic that makes life a lot simpler in Zombie Army 4. When players don't want to waste precious ammo on stragglers, stomping on downed enemies is a perfect solution. Just slide into a zombie or knock them down with melee before taking them out with a quick stomp.</p>
                <h3>Empty Your Lungs Efficiently
                </h3>
                <p>Using the Empty Lung mechanic is an extremely effective mechanic for players to keep in mind. It can help take out bosses and single enemies but is honestly a waste to use against hordes. This mechanic may make aiming a lot easier, but it will add a lot of time to each shot. It is a much better idea to switch to a secondary weapon to take out bigger hordes of enemies. Save this mechanic for lining up headshots on more difficult enemies.</p>
                <h3>Save Medkits
                </h3>
                <p>Medkits are an extremely limited resource and players are only capable of carrying a small amount. Typically these items will only be found in checkpoints and safehouses. These should be saved for extremely dire situations instead of wasted for every little injury. Save them up for when they are needed.</p>
                <h3>Use Melee
                </h3>
                <p>Melee attacks may not sound like they would be capable of doing much, but the players should definitely use melee attacks ever so often. This helps players stay alive for much longer. Players can use melee takedowns are by far one of the most powerful attacks that players can land but require players to perform ten melee attacks before the attack is charged up. The upside is that if players can land this attack they will earn both health and ammo to help them in their journey.</p>
                <h3>Play As A Team
                </h3>
                <p>It is possible to play Zombie Army 4 solo, but the game truly shines when playing cooperatively. Teaming up with other players is the best way to play, and players will get much more out of the game. The thing playing with someone else though is that players will need to learn how to play as a team. If the player has a good weapon or full ammo it may be a better idea to let their partner pick up an upgrade kit or supplies. This makes sure that the whole team is stocked up and more prepared for the struggles ahead.</p>
