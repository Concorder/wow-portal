               <h3>Use launch pads to re-activate your glider</h3>
                <p>One of the traps that you can pick up is the launch pad. After installing and activating, it allows you to reopen your glider. It has many applications, from reaching peak map positions to easily cutting horizontal distances short.

                    The trap can be triggered infinitely by anyone and cannot be restored after it has been placed. So, be careful where you station it and do not give the enemy team a competitive advantage. Once you reopen your glider you can also move much faster, which is useful to suddenly get closer to opponents by shortening the distance and gain great areal advantage. It is also good to escape the storm if you were too busy looting chests.</p>
            <h3>Know your loot colors
            </h3>
                <p>The Royal Battle Fortnite weapons are characterized by quality colors. They scale from bad to best, ranging from gray (common), green (uncommon), blue (rare), purple (epic) and orange (legendary). Each level increases the damage of the weapon.</p>


            <p>Aim to keep at least one uncommon weapon in your inventory if you are to survive combat. You can carry multiple good weapons, which you can change by using the stroller of your mouse.

                Sniper Rifles see the biggest damage increase. Therefore, they are one of the rarest weapons to find. If you manage to loot a legendary sniper rifle you are in business. Get on higher ground which is difficult to reach and keep your eyes peeled. With most battles being fought long range, you will always have the advantage.</p>

            <h3>How to Recover Health Fast
            </h3>
                <p>There are six main ways that you are able to restore your health in the game. They are bandages, medkits, mini shield potion, large shield potion, slup juices and chug jugs.

                    Bandages comes in packs of five, and each one will help to restore your health by 15 points. It’s worth noting though that they are never capable of restoring your to optimal health, only to 75 points, so keep this in mind when you are topping up your levels.</p>
            <p>Medkits are more powerful in the way that they can restore your health to the maximum levels of 100. You are only allowed to keep three medkits on you at any time.

                Mini shield potions are those blue juice tubes that can up your armour level by 25. Because they are so small, you’re able to hoard a fair deal of them at any one go. It’s always worth keeping at least two or three of these on you should disaster strike. Large shield potion will give you a 5- point shield onto your health. They are considered to be one of the most valuable healing potions in the game, so if you find them, be sure to keep them.</p>
            <p>Slurp juice will give you both 25 armour points and 25 health points over 25 seconds. If you get your hand on these rarities, it’s worth saving and drinking prior to an intense battle.

                Last but not least is the chung jug. This potion will take 15 seconds to down, so make sure that you are in a safe and secure spot when you do so. However, once consumed, the chug jug will restore your shield and health to the highest possible level</p>
