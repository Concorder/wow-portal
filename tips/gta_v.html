                <h3>Max Your Critical Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    All three characters start with different skill levels. Not all the skills are as meaningful as the others, but we recommend developing an expertise across the board in two critical areas - shooting and flying. You can sharpen your aim at Ammu-Nation gun ranges located throughout the region, or by racking up headshots in the open field. To master the control of planes and choppers, we highly recommend attending flight school, which is located at the Los Santos airport.
                </p>
                <h3>Play the Stock Market</h3>
                <p>One of the quickest ways to get rich in GTA V is to make smart investments on the two exchanges, LCN and BAWSAQ. You can access these markets from your phone or any computer. LCN is the more volatile market, prone to steep climbs and precipitous drops. BAWSAQ is much safer, but the payoff potential is lower. We recommend playing the market early and often. Pay attention to any business-related Weazel News reports, and listen carefully to the tips provided by characters in the game, particularly Lester.</p>
                <h3>Think Outside the Box During Police Chase
                </h3>
                <p>The police pursuit in GTA V is governed by line of sight. As any GTA vet knows, the higher your wanted level, the more comprehensive the police response is going to be. Our natural instinct is to escape escalating circumstances via vehicle. It's easier to shake them by going off-road - provided you have a vehicle up to the task. Another good tactic when you're on the freeway is to jump off to a lower level of interstate. It may seem counterintuitive, but sometimes driving isn't the smartest way to escape. If you're in a neighbourhood with alleys and backyards, sometimes it's easier to shake the cops on foot by jumping over fences or hiding under bridges.</p>
                <h3>Don't Forget Your Special Abilities
                </h3>
                <p>Each of the three protagonists has a unique special ability. Franklin can slow down time while driving, Michael can use a Max Payne-like bullet time to do the same during shootouts, and Trevor has a berserker-like ability to absorb a ton of damage while racking up kills. Use these special abilities whenever you can to improve them; when you get in a jam in later missions, you'll be grateful to have a larger meter. Of the three special abilities, Franklin's are the most useful. Being able to slow down time while driving 160 MPH through traffic is a godsend during chase missions, and it's also easier to line up shots while driving in slow motion.</p>
                <h3>Pick Your Get away Vehicles Wisely
                </h3>
                <p>Some heists require you to procure a getaway vehicle. Whatever you do, avoid using vehicles you have purchased for this purpose. E.g, you can make this mistake with a $100,000 sports car, tricked out to the fullest extent, and after the mission it will never be returned to the garage (which is the smart play for a criminal who wants to stay out of jail). Instead, we recommend hijacking a good getaway car, tricking it out at Los Santos Customs (the improved car armour and bulletproof tires are highly recommended), and dropping it off at the extraction point.</p>
