                <h3>Keep your defenders back
                </h3>
                <p>It can be very easy to get possession of the ball as a defender in Volta street football and then start making a dash for the opposing goal. If you see a clear opening, it might even make sense.

                    However, if you do this and lose possession immediately, you will be leaving your net wide open, and you will have very little chance to stop the other team from scoring. Stick to passing the ball to your midfielders or attackers in order to keep someone in proximity to your own net.</p>
                <h3>Don’t get too fancy with shots</h3>
                <p>FIFA 20 allows you to do all types of different shots, including “chip” shots and carefully-placed finesse shots, but these moves aren’t necessary for success in Volta Football. The ball will actually stay lower to the ground by default in the mode, making it easier to line up shots from farther away if need be.

                    However, the small size of the nets also means you still risk bouncing the ball off a wall or knocking it out of bounds. Don’t be afraid to get very close to the net before taking your shot, or even just dribbling the ball into the net when you can.</p>
                <h3>Master the through-pass
                </h3>
                <p>By pressing Triangle on PS4 or Y on Xbox One in FIFA 20, you can perform a “through-pass” to a teammate, which aims where they are going to be by the time the ball arrives rather than where they are currently standing.

                    Because there is no offside penalty in Volta, you can use the through-pass to open up huge holes in the defense and score an easy goal. Just don’t force a pass into a very crowded zone, as it can get intercepted and turned into a goal for the other side.</p>
                <h3>Control Revvy directly</h3>
                <p>As you beat teams in tournaments across the globe while playing Volta, you will have the option to recruit new members to your team. Not every player is eligible for recruitment – you can’t have children, for instance – but you can quickly improve your squad by choosing players to replace your weakest links.

                    Revvy plays an attacker role by default, and Syd will be guarding the net or playing as a defender. This means your midfielders will be the first to replace.

                    We heavily suggest you pick the latter option, at least when you’re starting out, as it gives you the chance to call for passes and learn where your teammates should position themselves. The computer-controlled players are also smart enough to push forward to receive passes, as well, so you can still rack up assists.</p>
                <h3>How to make the best Volta team</h3>
                <p>As with modes like FIFA Ultimate Team, you can place a player in any position you want on the pitch, but they will not be effective if playing an unfamiliar position.

                    Additionally, getting the highest possible team chemistry requires you to have everyone playing their preferred position, so make sure you have enough of each position in your roster to fill out the whole starting lineup.

                    Don’t forget to spend your skill points, either. After a few matches, you will have accumulated enough of them to improve several areas of Revvy’s game, including finishing ability and passing.

                    They won’t seem like major necessities early on, but by the time the Volta World Championships roll around, you’re going to need to pull out all the stops in order to win.</p>
