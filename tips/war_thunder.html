            <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>With millions of active players, War Thunder is an immensely popular vehicle-based war combat multiplayer game. For years, it's located among the top games in this genre and it is constantly drawing in new users who want to jump into its fast and fun action. No matter if the newcomers chose to do battle in a plane, tank or ship, they are all entering an amazing domain, especially for those interested in the real-life machines of war. However, it might be strange that in spite of these huge numbers and such level of popularity, many novice War Thunder players still start off really badly and keep getting frustrated by bad results and short gameplay session where they lose really quickly.

                    To help with that, here is the ultimate War Thunder beginners guide that will allow anyone to level up their game as soon as they start playing.</p>
                <h3>Knowing a Vehicle
                </h3>
                <p>War Thunder offers over one thousand vehicles that are ground, water and air-based. They are many diverse choices in each of those categories as well, offering the new players vertigo when all of these are taken into consideration. But, what is important about any vehicle choice is the understanding of its performances. Because of this, spending time in the hangar is essential. This includes reading about the vehicle, covering everything from speed to armor plating and armaments.

                    Every choice comes with its advantages and downsides. The most successful players are not those who possess the best vehicle - there is no such thing - but those who know their vehicles of choice and use what they have to its highest potential.</p>
                <h3>Making the Shots Count
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In the heat of combat, no one can blame the new War Thunder players for pushing down on that fire button for too long and far too often. But, a successful engagement is not determined by the number of shots but by their placement. This is why every new player must do whatever possible to make each and every shot they fire mean a good chance of connecting with their target. Otherwise, players only give away their position without leveraging this for the damage they cause.</p>

                <h3>Quickly moving on the Defense
                </h3>
                <p>In War Thunder, like in real-life warfare, no one can stay on the offense all of the time. Naturally, many players try to play the game like an old-school deathmatch, which includes rushing in and staying aggressive until they are put down. However, this style becomes boring really fast. Players need to learn to maneuver and quickly fall back when they are outgunned. An additional factor in this regard is the ability to align the vehicle so the damage they soak up is not terminal. This is a strategic way of thinking and it provides the best results in the long run.

                    Through the straightforward use of these simple elements of the War Thunder Beginner Guide, anyone who joins this fascinating war action game will be able to excel in it faster than they would ever expect.</p>
