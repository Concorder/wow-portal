            <h3>Don’t just spam basic attacks</h3>
                <p>Standard attacks don’t do much damage. Their primary purpose is to fill your ATB bars faster so that you to use your abilities and spells more often. While you may be able to beat the first few Shinra troopers by spamming the square button, that’s not going to last. Tougher enemies will easily withstand these attacks, and hit back much harder. Get into the habit of using combos to fill your ATB, and relying on abilities and spells to cause damage and stagger states.</p>
            <h3>Use magic!</h3>
                <p>It may be tempting to avoid using magic - after all, abilities only cost ATB, while spells cost ATB and MP. Don’t do that. Magic is there to be used. It’s incredibly effective in FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - you’ll be able to take out some foes much more efficiently with spells than abilities.</p>
            <h3>Take advantage of enemy weaknesses</h3>
                <p>Many enemies are weak against different types of magic, and you should take advantage of those vulnerabilities. On the other hand, if the enemy is mechanical, a crack of Thunder will give them a very nasty shock. This is particularly true in the boss fight against the Scorpion Sentinel - Cloud will even call that out, so take SOLDIER-boy’s advice!</p>
            <h3>Heal between fights
            </h3>
                <p>Enemies can dish out some serious damage in FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE, so you need to make sure you keep your HP topped up. You can use healing magic and potions mid-combat, but it uses a bar of ATB. But in-between battles, you can use as many items and spells as you like as often as you like.</p>
                <h3>Don’t forget that you can block</h3>
                <p>In FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE, offence isn’t always the best defense. Sometimes the best defense is… y’know, defense. Cloud and Barret can both block, which makes them take less damage from enemy attacks. They can also roll out of the way to avoid taking a hit completely.

                    For example, the Scorpion Sentinel boss has a powerful electrical area attack that knocks anyone caught on it off their feet. You can avoid this by rolling, but you can also avoid the knockback if you block.</p>
            <h3>Look around you</h3>
                <p>The demo area is full of things to find - and they’re all incredibly useful. Keep your eyes open for chests because they often contain recovery items - you can rely on these potions and ethers to keep you in tip-top shape.

                    The environment is also strewn with Shinra crates. If you see that familiar logo on a pile of boxes, smash them up because there may be something good inside.</p>
